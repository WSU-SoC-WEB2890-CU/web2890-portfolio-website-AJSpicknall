    <h1>Case Study: Campus Event Hub</h1>
    <p class="lead">A UX-focused redesign that helped students quickly find events matching their interests, schedules, and campus location.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Role:</strong> UX designer and front-end developer</p>
      <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 8 weeks</p>
      <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Reduce friction in event discovery and increase event attendance among first-year students.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>Students reported that event details were scattered across social channels, posters, and disconnected web pages. Most users missed time-sensitive events because they could not filter by date, category, and location quickly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Research + Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Interviewed 10 students from different majors and class years.</li>
        <li>Ran a competitive analysis of 4 event directory interfaces.</li>
        <li>Found that mobile filtering and calendar sync were top priorities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mapped user flows for browse, filter, and save-event tasks.</li>
        <li>Created low-fidelity wireframes focused on clear information hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Built an interactive prototype and tested with 6 users.</li>
        <li>Updated layout, labels, and filter behavior based on test feedback.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Accessibility Decisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved contrast beyond WCAG AA target for body and action text.</li>
        <li>Added strong focus indicators and logical keyboard traversal.</li>
        <li>Used semantic landmarks for easier screen reader navigation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>Usability testing after iteration showed a 39% reduction in time to find a relevant event and complete a calendar-save action. Participants described the final version as easier to scan and less overwhelming on mobile.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project reinforced the value of pairing visual design with clear task flows. The strongest improvements came from testing early and changing interaction details before full development.</p>
